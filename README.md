# G29-Shifter-Mod
The G29 magnet mod by Goose Designs
———————————————————————————————————
This was not my original concept, and there are many like this out there, but this particular design was created by me.
If you are looking for a 10mm magnet mod this will be released soon on my GitHub.

Printing
————————
This particular model works best a higher end printer that can print with very small tolerances. I printed it on my P1S by BambuLab in their regular PLA with a 0.2mm nozzle, a layer height of 0.08mm and 15% rectilinear infill with auto generated supports for the overhanging screw holes. Due to the use of threaded inserts, it is necessary to increase the wall loops to 4 instead of the default 2. This should work well with other filaments, but PLA is cheap and worked great for me.

Assembly
————————
Assemble with M3 threaded inserts and M3 screws. The magnets are press fit, but a dab of superglue is highly recommended as it provides more durability and reliability for the device.
